### :rocket: Welcome to the left side of my brain! :rocket:

:notebook: **Portfolio**

You can see my portfolio at [Ondaniel](https://ondaniel.com.br/).

:fire: **Current**

Working hard at [Spiry Capital](https://spiry.ro/) creating a new SaaS version of [Battlestation](https://dashboard.spiry.ro/).

:computer: **Projects and Work**

Most of my projects are open source, like [Wellets](https://github.com/ondanieldev/wellets-frontend), [microchat](https://github.com/ondanieldev/microservices-chat), [news-proxy](https://github.com/ondanieldev/news-proxy) and [onloto](https://github.com/ondanieldev/onloto).

I worked at a school and developed systems to improve their management. Two of these projects started as open source and are still storaged on my GitHub. You can access them at [sisgie](https://github.com/ondanieldev/santiago) and [enrollments](https://github.com/ondanieldev/santiago-reenrollments).

Actually, I work at [Spiry Media Investment Group](https://spiry.ro/) as a fullstack developer.
