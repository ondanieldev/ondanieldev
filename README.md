### Welcome to the left side of my brain! :rocket:

:headphones: **About**

I'm **18 years old** and I started to be interested in programming at 14.

I work mainly with **NodeJS, ReactJS and TypeScript**.

I'm currently studying Information Systems at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (**UFMG**) in order to obtain opportunities to learn **robotics** from a scientific point of view.

I'm also learning about **blockchain** and improoving my **english** on my own.

I listen **music** all day and it's like my gasoline (**coffee** also has responsibility in this).

In short, I love **robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, web development, linux**, and much more!

Sometimes, I also edit **photos and videos**, but I'm just an amateur.

:computer: **Projects**

Most of my projects are open source, like [microchat](https://github.com/stemDaniel/microservices-chat), [news-proxy](https://github.com/stemDaniel/news-proxy) and [onloto](https://github.com/stemDaniel/onloto).
